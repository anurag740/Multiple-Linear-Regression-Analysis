# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Analysis
This project demonstrates the application of multiple linear regression to predict sales based on advertising expenditures in TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps, using Python and various data science libraries.


Key Components:

Data Loading and Exploration:

The dataset contains columns for TV, Radio, Newspaper expenditures, and Sales.
Initial data exploration and visualization using seaborn to understand relationships between variables.
Data Preprocessing:

Checked for missing values and ensured data quality.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

Implemented a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn.
Fitted the model on the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Predicted sales on the test data.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score.
The model achieved an R-squared score of 0.909, indicating a good fit.
Technologies Used:

Python
pandas
seaborn
scikit-learn
NumPy
Conclusion:
This project successfully illustrates how multiple linear regression can be used to predict sales based on different advertising channels, showcasing essential steps in data analysis and model evaluation.
